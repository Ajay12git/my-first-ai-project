# My First AI Project

👋 Hi! I'm exploring how AI products are built and used.  
This repository will hold small projects and notes as I learn about:
- OpenAI APIs
- LangChain & LLM applications
- AI agents and evaluation frameworks

## Goals
- Learn how to use GitHub effectively
- Document my experiments clearly
- Build a small AI demo in the next step 🚀
